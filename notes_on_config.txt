Looks like:

1. prefix should be set to directory containing config file

2. dataset should be just name of the subfolder (of the folder that contains config) with the .dat

3. corpus = line.toml should be kept in the same folder with .dat

4. stop-words has to be the full abs path or full relative path to the stopwords file.

5. query-judgements has to be the full abs path or the full relative path to the query-rels file

6. query-path should be just name of the queries text. queries.txt should be stored with .dat

7. index?? what does it do?
